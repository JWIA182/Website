# FocusFlow

FocusFlow is a modern, distraction-free productivity dashboard inspired by Pomofocus. It now pairs the adaptive Pomodoro timer, task manager, and insights UI with a lightweight Node/Express backend so that focus stats, settings, and tasks stay in sync across sessions.

## Features
- **Timer modes** for focus, short break, and long break with automatic cycle tracking.
- **Task list** with Pomodoro estimates, completion tracking, and quick selection for the active session.
- **Insights** showing total focus minutes, session count, completed tasks, and streaks.
- **Settings** for custom durations, long-break cadence, auto-start, and completion chimes.
- **API-backed sync** so your tasks, timer preferences, and focus streaks survive refreshes and can be shared between browsers hitting the same service.

## Getting started
1. Start the backend API:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   npm start
   ```
   The server listens on `http://localhost:4000` by default and stores data in `backend/data.json`.
2. In a second terminal, serve the frontend (any static server works). For example:
   ```bash
   python -m http.server 3000
   ```
3. Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser. When running on `localhost`, the UI automatically talks to `http://localhost:4000/api`.
4. Begin a focus session, add tasks, and customize the timer lengths to suit your flow.

### Configuring the API base
If you deploy the backend on a different origin, define `window.FOCUSFLOW_API_BASE` before `app.js` loads:

```html
<script>
  window.FOCUSFLOW_API_BASE = "https://focusflow.example.com/api";
</script>
<script src="app.js" defer></script>
```

This ensures all fetch calls point to the correct REST endpoint.

## Deployment

Production deployments run the static frontend (via any CDN or web server) and the Node/Express API side-by-side. Ensure requests from the frontend can reach the backend's `/api` routes either by:

- Hosting both behind the same domain and proxying `/api` to the Node server, or
- Setting `window.FOCUSFLOW_API_BASE` (as above) so the frontend calls the fully qualified backend URL.

## Technologies
- Vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript modules for the UI.
- Node.js + Express + JSON file storage for the REST API.
- Accessible, responsive layout designed for both desktop and mobile.
